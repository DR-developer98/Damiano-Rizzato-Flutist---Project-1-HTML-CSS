<h3>Navigation bar</h3>
The navigation bar is displayed on all five pages (homepage, concerts, recordings, get in touch and success pages), it's fully responsive and presents the logo (which enables navigation to the home page), all navigation links as well as two in-page links, namely Newsletter and About.
The navbar looks on all pages the same, to allow for easy navigation.

<h3>Footer/Newsletter</h3>
The footer section, which looks on all website pages and is fully responsive on all main screen sizes, comprises two elements:
<ul>
<li><strong>the newsletter section</strong> (accessible from any page via in-page link "Newsletter" in the navbar"), which compries a short call to action and an e-mail input for the user to be able to sign up for it;</li>
<li><strong>the social media section</strong> includes links to all the links to the flutist's relevant social media sites. The links will open to a new tab to allow for an easy navigation for the user.</li> 
</ul>
The footer section on the website addresses the third and the fourth user story, allowing the user to receive updates on upcoming concerts, projects and recordings directly to their mailbox and to navigate to the flutist's different social media profiles and view the different types of content he publishes.

<h3>About</h3>
The About section, located in the homepage directly under the hero-image, serves the user in that it directly addresses the first user story, providing them with the flutist's background information. This section is accessible from all pages by means of the "About" nav link in the navigation bar.

<h3>Concerts</h3>
The concerts page displays a list of upcoming performances. 
The user will be provided with basic relevant information on the concerts such as the venue, the date, the time, the program and the name of the other musicians. At the bottom of each card there is a "Buy tickets" button, which redirects the user to the venue website relevant page, where they will be able to purchase tickets for the concert.
Currently, all the displayed information is made up, therefore any reference to people, dates, program titles and composition is purely coincidental. This section will be updated with real concerts.

<h3>Recordings</h3>
The recordings page presents the user with four highlight recordings from Damiano's YouTube channel and with a link at the bottom of the page to Damiano's YouTube channel; in this way, visitors of the website who might be curious to listen to more content, can do so. 
This section will be kept up to date with the flutist's most recent recordings.
