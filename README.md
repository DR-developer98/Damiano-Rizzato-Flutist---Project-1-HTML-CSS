<h1><strong>Damiano Rizzato - Flutist</strong></h1>
is a website designed to bring venues, artistic directors and people who already follow me (Damiano Rizzato) on my other social media platforms in contact with me.
The website is meant as a landing page that allows the different types of visitors:
<ul>
<li>to learn more about my background;</li>
<li>to stay up to date on my concerts and projects</li>
<li>to listen to my recordings</li>
<li>to get in touch with me to discuss concert and project ideas and/or to book me for a concert</li>
</ul>
The main business objective is for the flutist to get more gigs, which is reflected in the website navigation bar.
