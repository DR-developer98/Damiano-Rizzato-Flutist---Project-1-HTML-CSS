<h3>Footer</h3>
The footer section, which appears on all website pages and is fully responsive on all major screen sizes, comprises two key elements:
<ul>
<li><strong>the newsletter section:</strong> accessible from any page via an in-page link ("Newsletter") in the navbar, this section includes a short call to action and an email input field for users to sign up. Clicking on "sign up" will redirect the user to a feedback page, with a short thank-you-for-signing-up text as well as a "Return to homepage" button.
<br>
<strong style="color: red">Note:</strong> on many websites, the feedback given to the users upon signing up for a newsletter is a strip of text appearing below the email input field. As this requires JavaScript and as I didn't possess the right set of skills at the time of me designing this website, I chose to create a whole feedback page</li>

<img src="assets/images-for-README/Success-newsletter.webp" style="width: 75%">

<li><strong>the social media section:</strong> this section includes links to all of the flutist's relevant social media sites. These links open in a new tab, ensuring easy navigation for the user.</li> 
</ul>
The footer section addresses the third and fourth user stories, enabling users to receive updates on upcoming concerts, projects, and recordings directly in their mailbox, as well as easily navigate to the flutist's various social media profiles to view the different types of content he publishes.

<strong style="color: red">Note:</strong> dates, times, programs and the musicians' names are all fictional, therefore any reference to real people and events is purely coincidental. This section will be updated with real events in the future.

<h2>Testing</h2>
<h3>Validator testing</h3>

<ul>
<li>HTML
<ul>
<li>In recordings.html I removed the "frameboarder: 0" inline CSS style of the iframes and replaced it with external CSS "border: none." <strong style="color: green">Credit:</strong> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe_frameborder_css" target="_blank">W3School</a></li>
<li>Added closing tags/Removed unnecessary opening tags</li>
<li>Substituted the button mistakingly nested inside an anchor element (Get-in-touch button in navbar) by using the code hereinafter.

<img src="assets/images-for-README/display-link-as-button-solution.webp">
<li>Since the abovementioned code doesn't allow to create buttons that open on a new tab, in order to make the "Buy tickets" buttons for the concerts page and the "Return to homepage" buttons for the feedback pages for newsletter and get-in-touch form, this code â†“ was used.

</li>
<li>In concerts.html, in the .concert-text section of each concert card, the Validator was giving this error message: "Error: No p element in scope but a p end tag seen.". This was caused by those "p"'s incorrectly cointaining the block-level element "ul". This was fixed by removing the "p"'s as containers of those unordered lists. <strong style="color: green">Credit:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/issues/1101">github.com/validator/validator/issues/1101</a></li>
<li>In get-in-touch.html, the #form section was lacking a heading. This was solved by turning the section #form element into a div#form element and by removing the unnecessary direct div-child.</li>
<li>With regard to the confirmation pages for the get in touch form and the newsletter signup section no errors were returned when passing through the official <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C validator</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CSS
<ul>
<li>Removed padding-bottom: -10px from #newsletter section in footer, since negative padding values aren't allowed.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Lighthouse report</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added "link rel="preload" as="image" href="path-to-your-image.jpg"" to "head" element of all pages in order to improve the LCP. Integrating this pushed lighthouse performacen rate of the homepage up to 83%.<br>
<strong style="color: green">Credit: </strong><a href="https://speedvitals.com/blog/preload-lcp-image/" target="_blank">speedvitals.com</a></li>
<li>Added width: 120px to logo in the navbar to improve Lighthouse performance score.</li>

<h3>Fixed bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the navbar the navlinks and the get in touch button weren't aligned. 
This was fixed by adding some padding-top to the links and by overriding this property for the get in touch button by using the pseudo class selector nav li:last-child.<br>
<strong style="color: green">Credit: </strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-child" target="_blank">developer.mozilla.org</a></li>
<li>The main heading in the recordings page wasn't the same size as the one in the concerts page, despite having set the same stle rule for it. This was fixed by changing the relationship #recordings>h1 (parent-child) to #recordings h1 (ancestor-descendant).</li>
</ul>

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. 
The steps to deploy are as follows:
<ol>
