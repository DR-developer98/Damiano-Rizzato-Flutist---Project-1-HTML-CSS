<h1>Damiano Rizzato - Flutist</h1>
Welcome to the official professional website of Damiano Rizzato, created to connect venues, artistic directors, classical music enthusiasts, and social media followers with Damiano.

This website serves as a landing page that allows various visitors, most likely adults, located in the Zaanstad area in the Netherlands, to:

<ul>
<li>Discover more about his background and career;</li>
<li>Stay updated on his concerts and projects;</li>
<li>Listen to his recordings;</li>
<li>Contact him to discuss concert and project ideas or to book him for an event;</li>
</ul>
The primary business objective is to help the flutist secure more performance opportunities, emphasized by the prominent "Get in touch" button in the website's navigation bar.

<h2>Relevant User Stories</h2>
The foundation of this website is built on the following user stories:

<ol>
<li>As an Instagram follower, I want to find a biography section, so I can learn more about Damiano's background.</li>
<li>As a regular concert attendee, I want to see a list of upcoming performances with clear details about time, date, venue, and program, so I can find events that interest me and fit my schedule.</li>
<li>As a classical music enthusiast, I want to subscribe to Damiano's newsletter, so I can receive updates on his upcoming performances, new recordings, and behind-the-scenes insights directly in my inbox.</li>
<li>As a classical music enthusiast, I want easy access to Damiano's social media profiles, so I can stay updated with his latest activities, performances, and content on various platforms.</li>
<li>As the manager of a concert venue, I want to listen to some of Damiano's recordings, so I can determine if he's a good fit for the concert I am organizing.</li>
<li>As an artistic director, I want to get in touch with Damiano, so I can discuss concert and project ideas with him.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Navigation bar</h3>
<ul>
<li>The navigation bar is displayed on all five pages (homepage, concerts, recordings, get in touch and success pages), it's fully responsive and presents the logo (which enables navigation to the home page), all navigation links as well as two in-page links, namely Newsletter and About.</li>
<li>This section enables seamless navigation across all devices, allowing users to move from page to page without needing to use the 'back' button.</li>
</ul>

<img src="assets/images-for-README/navigation-bar.webp">

<h3>Footer</h3>
The footer section, which appears on all website pages and is fully responsive on all major screen sizes, comprises two key elements:
<ul>
<li><strong>the newsletter section:</strong> accessible from any page via an in-page link ("Newsletter") in the navbar, this section includes a short call to action and an email input field for users to sign up. Clicking on "sign up" will redirect the user to a feedback page, with a short thank-you-for-signing-up text as well as a "Return to homepage" button.
<br>
<strong style="color: red">Note:</strong> on many websites, the feedback given to the users upon signing up for a newsletter is a strip of text appearing below the email input field. As this requires JavaScript and as I didn't possess the right set of skills at the time of me designing this website, I chose to create a whole feedback page</li>

<img src="assets/images-for-README/Success-newsletter.webp" style="width: 75%">

<li><strong>the social media section:</strong> this section includes links to all of the flutist's relevant social media sites. These links open in a new tab, ensuring easy navigation for the user.</li> 
</ul>
The footer section addresses the third and fourth user stories, enabling users to receive updates on upcoming concerts, projects, and recordings directly in their mailbox, as well as easily navigate to the flutist's various social media profiles to view the different types of content he publishes.

<h3>Landing page image</h3>
The landing includes a photograph of Damiano with text overlay with his full name.
This section introduces the user to the flutist with a photo from one of his performances.

<img src="assets/images-for-README/Landing-page.webp" style="width: 75%">

<h3>About</h3>
The About section, located in the homepage directly under the hero-image, serves the user in that it directly addresses the first user story, providing them with the flutist's background information. This section is accessible from all pages by means of "About" nav link.

<img src="assets/images-for-README/About-section.webp" style="width: 75%">

<h3>Concerts</h3>
The concerts page lists upcoming performances with details like venue, date, time, program, and collaborators' names. Each card consists of two parts:
<ul>
<li>Venue picture, which upon clicking will redirect the user to the venue's homepage;</li>
<li>Concert description section, which includes all useful information as well as a "Buy tickets" button that - currently - links to the venue's homepage. </li>
</ul> 
<strong style="color: red">Note:</strong> dates, times, programs and the musicians' names are all fictional, therefore any reference to real people and events is purely coincidental. This section will be updated with real events in the future.

<img src="assets/images-for-README/Concerts-page.webp" style="width: 75%">

<h3>Recordings</h3>
The recordings page features eight highlight recordings from Damiano's YouTube channel and a link to the full channel at the bottom. This section will regularly be updated with the flutist's latest recordings.
This feature addresses user story #5, providing artistic directors and venues the possibility to easily access and review the latest performances and works by Damiano, helping them make informed decisions regarding potential bookings and collaborations. 

<img src="assets/images-for-README/recordings-page.webp" style="width: 75%">

<h3>Get in touch</h3>
This page will allow primarily concert venue managers and artistic directors to get in touch with Damiano, in order to discuss concert and project ideas with him. This page consists of two elements:
<ul>
<li><strong>a hero image with a text overlay</strong></li>

<img src="assets/images-for-README/get-in-touch-hero-image.webp" style="width: 75%">

<li><strong>the get-in-touch form</strong>, where the user will be able to specify the subject of their query/proposal and to type out their message in the textarea.

<img src="assets/images-for-README/get-in-touch-form.webp" style="width: 75%">

All the fields must be filled in, in order to meet the form submission requirements. After clicking on submit, the user will be redirected to a feedback page, which comprises a short thank-you-for-reaching-out text as well as a "Return to homepage" button.
</li>

<img src="assets/images-for-README/feedback-page-get-in-touch.webp" style="width: 75%">
</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>
I tested that this website works across some of the major Browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
I also ran manual tests on the following devices and the website worked on all of them as expected.
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile phones:</strong> Samsung A52, Iphone 7 Plus;</li>
<li><strong>Tablet:</strong> Galaxy Tab A (2016)</li>
<li><strong>Laptop:</strong> Lenovo </li>
</ul>
For responsiveness and tests on devices larger than the ones mentioned above I used the Browser Dev Tools.

<h3 style="color: darkred">Validator testing</h3>

<h4 style="color: orange">HTML</h4>
<p>The website HTML was tested using <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C validator</a></p>

<h5>1) Fixed bugs</h5>

<ul>
<li>In recordings.html I removed the "frameboarder: 0" inline CSS style of the iframes and replaced it with external CSS "border: none." <strong style="color: green">Credit:</strong> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe_frameborder_css" target="_blank">W3School</a></li>
<li>Added closing tags/Removed unnecessary opening tags</li>
<li>Substituted the button mistakingly nested inside an anchor element (Get-in-touch button in navbar) by using the code hereinafter.
<strong style="color: green">Credit:</strong> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2906582/how-do-i-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link" target="_blank">Stackoverflow</a></li>

<img src="assets/images-for-README/display-link-as-button-solution.webp">
<li>Since the abovementioned code doesn't allow to create buttons that open on a new tab, in order to make the "Buy tickets" buttons for the concerts page and the "Return to homepage" buttons on the feedback pages, this code â†“ was used.
<br>
<strong style="color: green">Credit:</strong> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_link_advanced" target="_blank">W3School</a>
</li>

<img src="assets/images-for-README/code-link-turned-into-button-copilot.webp">

<li>In concerts.html, in the .concert-text section of each concert card, the Validator was giving this error message: "Error: No p element in scope but a p end tag seen.". This was caused by the paragraphs incorrectly cointaining the block-level element "ul". This was fixed by removing the paragraphs as containers of those unordered lists. <strong style="color: green">Credit:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/issues/1101">github.com/validator/validator/issues/1101</a></li>

<li>In get-in-touch.html, the #form section was lacking a heading. This was solved by turning the section #form element into a div#form element and by removing the unnecessary direct div-child.</li>

<li>With regard to the confirmation pages for the get in touch form and the newsletter signup section no errors were returned when passing through the official Validator.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the navbar the navlinks and the get in touch button weren't aligned. 
This was fixed by adding some padding-top to the links and by overriding this property for the get in touch button by using the pseudo class selector nav li:last-child.<br>
<strong style="color: green">Credit: </strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-child" target="_blank">developer.mozilla.org</a></li>
<li>The main heading in the recordings page wasn't the same size as the one in the concerts page, despite having set the same stle rule for it. This was fixed by changing the relationship #recordings>h1 (parent-child) to #recordings h1 (ancestor-descendant).</li>
<li>In the recordings page, the link to the YouTube channel in the call-to-action paragraph at the bottom of the page wasn't changing color when :hover nor when :visited. This was due to the relevant pseudo-classes not being in the right order. This was fixed by applying the LoVe HaTe mnemonic:
<br>
L: a:link - Default state of the link.

V: a:visited - After the link has been clicked.

H: a:hover - When the user hovers over the link.

A: a:active - When the link is being clicked.
<br>
<strong style="color: green">Credit:</strong> <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/link-pseudo-classes-in-order/" target="_blank">css-tricks.com</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Unfixed bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>On mobile phones the menu doesn't automatically collapse when clicking on a inpage link. This means that pressing/clicking on "Newsletter" on any page will direct the user to the footer, but the menu won't collapse. The same applies to "About" in the homepage. 
This can be fixed by using JavaScript, which falls outside of the scope of this project.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deployment</h3>

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. 
The steps to deploy are as follows:
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the GitHub Repository;</li>
<li>Click on the "Settings" tab on the top navigation bar;</li>
<li>Click on "Pages" on the left navigation menu";</li>
<li>Ensure the "Source" is set to "Deploy from a Branch";</li>
<li>Ensure the "Branch" is set to "Main"</li>
<li>Click on "Save";</li>
<li>The page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.</li>
</ol>
