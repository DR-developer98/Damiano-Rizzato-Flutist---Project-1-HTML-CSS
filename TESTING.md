<h1>TESTING</h1>

I tested that this website works across some of the major Browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
I also ran manual tests on the following devices and the website worked on all of them as expected.
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile phones:</strong> Samsung A52, Iphone 7 Plus;</li>
<li><strong>Tablet:</strong> Galaxy Tab A (2016)</li>
<li><strong>Laptop:</strong> Lenovo </li>
</ul>
For responsiveness and tests on devices larger than the ones mentioned above I used the Browser Dev Tools.

<h3 style="color: darkred">Validator testing</h3>

<h4 style="color: orange">HTML</h4>
<p>The website HTML was tested using <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C validator</a></p>

<h5>1) Fixed bugs</h5>

<ul>
<li>In recordings.html I removed the "frameboarder: 0" inline CSS style of the iframes and replaced it with external CSS "border: none." <strong style="color: green">Credit:</strong> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe_frameborder_css" target="_blank">W3School</a></li>
<li>Added closing tags/Removed unnecessary opening tags</li>
<li>Substituted the button mistakingly nested inside an anchor element (Get-in-touch button in navbar) by using the code hereinafter.

<img src="assets/images-for-README/display-link-as-button-solution.webp">
<li>Since the abovementioned code doesn't allow to create buttons that open on a new tab, in order to make the "Buy tickets" buttons for the concerts page and the "Return to homepage" buttons on the feedback pages, this code â†“ was used.

</li>

<img src="assets/images-for-README/code-link-turned-into-button-copilot.webp">

<li>In concerts.html, in the .concert-text section of each concert card, the Validator was giving this error message: "Error: No p element in scope but a p end tag seen.". This was caused by the paragraphs incorrectly cointaining the block-level element "ul". This was fixed by removing the paragraphs as containers of those unordered lists. <strong style="color: green">Credit:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/validator/validator/issues/1101">github.com/validator/validator/issues/1101</a></li>

<li>In get-in-touch.html, the #form section was lacking a heading. This was solved by turning the section #form element into a div#form element and by removing the unnecessary direct div-child.</li>

<li>With regard to the confirmation pages for the get in touch form and the newsletter signup section no errors were returned when passing through the official Validator.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the navbar the navlinks and the get in touch button weren't aligned. 
This was fixed by adding some padding-top to the links and by overriding this property for the get in touch button by using the pseudo class selector nav li:last-child.<br>
<strong style="color: green">Credit: </strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-child" target="_blank">developer.mozilla.org</a></li>
<li>The main heading in the recordings page wasn't the same size as the one in the concerts page, despite having set the same stle rule for it. This was fixed by changing the relationship #recordings>h1 (parent-child) to #recordings h1 (ancestor-descendant).</li>
<li>In the recordings page, the link to the YouTube channel in the call-to-action paragraph at the bottom of the page wasn't changing color when :hover nor when :visited. This was due to the relevant pseudo-classes not being in the right order. This was fixed by applying the LoVe HaTe mnemonic:
<br>
L: a:link - Default state of the link.

V: a:visited - After the link has been clicked.

H: a:hover - When the user hovers over the link.

A: a:active - When the link is being clicked.

</ul>

<h3>Unfixed bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>On mobile phones the menu doesn't automatically collapse when clicking on a inpage link. This means that pressing/clicking on "Newsletter" on any page will direct the user to the footer, but the menu won't collapse. The same applies to "About" in the homepage. 
This can be fixed by using JavaScript, which falls outside of the scope of this project.</li>
</ul>
